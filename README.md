# ML Projects
### Cluster Analysis
Dataset contaied multiple columns of text, the goal of the project was to undrestand themes/ternds within the data.
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (Unigram and Bigram frequency distribution)
2. Use Flair library, embedding each row as a document.
3. Identify optimal cluster grouping using inertia values and Elbow plot.
4. Use Kmeans and compare with/withour PCA transformation (obtain cluster labels).
5. Use bigram frequency distribution to visualize theme within each cluster.
